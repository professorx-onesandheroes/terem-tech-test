# Requirements

Terem Technologies - Front End Test
Summary
We are looking for a high attention to UI detail and component based design.
There is no need to spend more than four hours on this test, we do not expect the whole
test to be completed.

3. (Bonus) Light/Dark mode

What we’re primarily assessing
Bespoke carousel component design
Or
Pre-made carousel library with well considered testing

Some other things we’ll be looking at
Code style
Organisation of styling
Use of modern language/tech features
Meaningful tests

Submission
Git repository link (please do not send a zip); We prefer public GitHub repo’s
total time spent (approx.)
(Bonus) Have it deployed using something like Netlify/Vercel

Lastly
We understand software engineering requires discourse. Whether it’s confirming
assumptions, clarification of acceptance criteria or general feedback, it’s all welcome.

Future improvements

- Routing
- API integration
- Images are in public folder, should be a url to an online resource (e.g. Azure blob)
- Config in .env variables
- Dark mode needs more features, just a simple version was implemented
- Some styling issues (long text overlap in cards)
